#### It's a model trained on multiple CNN architectures widely used for image classification i.e. InceptionV3, Xception, VGG16, ResNet, and for detection used YOLOv8. 

#### For training the TACO dataset was used

#### The models are result of transfer learning and fine tuning on multiple different models. Also, demo videos are present detecting litter.
